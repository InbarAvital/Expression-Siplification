# Expression-Siplification
This is a simple expression simplifier I coded.
Notice that there is a better simplifier in the "bonus" section.
The simple simplifier is doing basic simplifications. The bonus simplification, however
is doing much more - I added a recursive simplification I thought of for expressions
that does not include sin/cos etc. It knows how to enter an expression deep inside and
basically "take out" variables if needed. It is really cool! :)
The bonus also includes many other simplifications that I did not do in the basic one,
you can see examples for all of the simplifications in the "simplificationDemo" file.

Notice you can also download the zip file if you want to run it in your computer :)

Have fun!
